my young cousin that accepted the jobs last month explored the magnificent mountain .
the competent clinician that accepted the jobs eagerly needed the famous equations urgently .
the physicians that accepted the exciting challenge called the doctors eagerly .
my really uptight colleague that accompanied the quite gentle teacher opened the green doors reluctantly .
the kids that accompanied the child spilled the syrup last week .
the really young teachers that accompanied the gentle parent cleaned the shiny glass .
the teachers that accompanied the kids filled the glasses last month .
the kids that accompanied the teacher last month quickly swallowed the syrup .
the kid that accompanied my cousins sadly cracked the shiny glass .
the child that accompanied my cousin dropped the glasses last month .
